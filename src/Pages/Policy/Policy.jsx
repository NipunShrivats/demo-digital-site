                Suggested text: When visitors leave comments on the site we
                collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the
                visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam
                detection. An anonymized string created from your email address
                (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to
                see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is
                available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval
                of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public
                in the context of your comment.

                opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in
                cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have
                to fill in your details again when you leave another comment.
                These cookies will last for one year. If you visit our login
                page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your
                browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data
                and is discarded when you close your browser. When you log in,
                we will also set up several cookies to save your login

                Suggested text: Articles on this site may include embedded
                content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content
                from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the
                visitor has visited the other website. These websites may
                collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
                third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that
                embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
                embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to
                that website.

                Suggested text: If you leave a comment, the comment and its
                metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize
                and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of
                holding them in a moderation queue. For users that register on
                our website (if any), we also store the personal information
                they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or
                delete their personal information at any time (except they
                cannot change their username). Website administrators can also
                see and edit that information.

                provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal
                data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are
